Standard parameterization values

ARes = 100
	aboveground resources - not changed since May et al. (2009)
BRes = 60
	belowground ressources - medium level; tested in Weiß et al. (2014) for values of 30, 60, and 90
GrazProb = 0.2
	medium grazing level - (weekly grazing probability); varied in Weiß et al. (2014)
propRemove = 0.5
	amount of biomass removed; both parameter varied in Koerner et al. (2014)
DistAreaYear = 0
	trampling disabled;
AreaEvent = 0.1
	parameter for weekly trampling disturbance
NCut = 0
	parameter for cutting; NCut=0 - no cutting, 1-cutting after seed set (autumn), 2- cutting in spring and autumn, 3-cutting in spring, autumn and before seed set (summer)
CutMass = 5000
	CutMass is a (standard 5000) value for cutting depth
SeedRain = 0
	Seed Rain parameters after Weiß et al. (2014): SeedRain is the mode (0=no)
Seedinput = 2900
	Seedinput is the amount of seeds/ seed biomass
